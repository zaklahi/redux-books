# FS Redux

Pull down the code, npm install and setup a database called `fs-redux-books` w/ the provided `database.sql` file. 


The starter code has several components & redux setup with TODO's:

 - The `bookList` reducer in `index.js` is missing code to handle Redux actions.
 - The `BookForm` is already setup w/`handleSubmit`, but there is a TODO in the `handleSubmit` for the axios request.
 - The `App` component is missing an axios request, to fetch the initial book data from the server.
